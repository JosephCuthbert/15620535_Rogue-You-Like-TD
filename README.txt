# 15620535_Rogue-You-Like TD

This project is based on reusing assets from a Unity tutorial. We were given
complete creative control over the project, as long as there was 1 major
difference. We could choose any genre, as long as the assets are all the same.
Only the UI could have custom assets. 

The main challenge was that we had to add a feature that was not normal for 
the chosen genre. With my project I chose to use a gambling feature as this 
is not a normal feature for Tower-Defence games. Though the game was not 
submitted, they ensured that a video was submitted showcasing at least
2 minutes and every major feature of the game. For this assignment I got 
62% or an Upper-Second. 

Thank you for looking at my work.
